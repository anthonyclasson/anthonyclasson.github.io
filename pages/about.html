            <p>     Hello and welcome to my homepage. My name is Anthony Classon and I am currently a masters student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA.
                    I completed my undergraduate degree at Boston University in 2014 where I double majored in Biology and Mathematics. 
            </p>
            <p>     I grew up in Melbourne, Australia, before moving to the US at the age of 16.
                    I am a huge fan of Australian rules football and I support the Collingwood Magpies.
                    Since I've been in the USA I have started following the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia Eagles.
